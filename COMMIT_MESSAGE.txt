feat!: Rename module to SwiftBigInt to fix module stability compilation

BREAKING CHANGE: Module name changed from BigInt to SwiftBigInt

## Problem
The module name "BigInt" conflicted with the struct name "public struct BigInt",
causing Swift compiler errors when building with BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES
(required for XCFramework distribution and module stability):

```
error: 'BigInt' is not a member type of struct 'BigInt.BigInt'
```

## Solution
Renamed the module to "SwiftBigInt" following Swift community conventions
(similar to SwiftNIO, SwiftLog, SwiftCrypto).

## Changes
- Package name: Remains "BigInt" (matches repository name)
- Product name: BigInt → SwiftBigInt
- Module name: BigInt → SwiftBigInt
- Type names: UNCHANGED (BigInt and BigUInt structs remain the same)

## Migration for Consumers
Only import statements need to change:

```swift
// Before (v5.x):
import BigInt

// After (v6.0+):
import SwiftBigInt

// Type names unchanged:
let x = BigInt(100)   // ✓ Still works
let y = BigUInt(50)   // ✓ Still works
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Fixes module stability compilation errors
- ✅ Enables XCFramework distribution without compiler workarounds
- ✅ Eliminates need for -no-verify-emitted-module-interface flag
- ✅ Follows Swift community naming conventions
- ✅ Minimal breaking changes (import statements only)

## Files Modified
- Package.swift: Updated module and product names
- All test files (18 files): Updated imports
- Demo playground files (5 files): Updated imports
- README.md: Added migration guide
- Documentation: Updated import examples

## Version
Requires major version bump: 5.4.0 → 6.0.0

Fixes module interface verification bug when building with library evolution enabled.
