feat!: Rename module to SwiftBigInt to fix module stability compilation

BREAKING CHANGE: Module name changed from BigInt to SwiftBigInt

Fixes Swift compiler error when building with BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES:
"'BigInt' is not a member type of struct 'BigInt.BigInt'"

Changes:
- Product/module name: BigInt → SwiftBigInt
- Package name: Remains "BigInt" (repository name)
- Type names: UNCHANGED (BigInt/BigUInt still work)

Migration: Only import statements change from `import BigInt` to `import SwiftBigInt`

Follows Swift naming conventions (SwiftNIO, SwiftLog, SwiftCrypto).
Requires version bump to 6.0.0.
